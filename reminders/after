  homebrew packages will not be upgraded automatically, so you'll need to do that manually:
    `brew upgrade [package]` or `brew upgrade` to upgrade all packages

  Some other things that still need to be done manually:

    - Organize the finder sidebar favorites
    - Setup Mailplane accounts
    - Setup Google internet account(s)
    - Add Slack accounts
    - iTunes setup
    - AppStore manual installs:
        - Diagrammix
    - AnyTrans license will need to be manually unbound by contacting their support,
      additionally the license activation doesn't seem to work automated

  Some notes on what to install on iPhone:

    - Chase

    - 1Password
    - Slack
    - Evernote
